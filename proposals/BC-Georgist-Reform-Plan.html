		<p>This is a tax reform proposal for British Columbia. The BC Georgist Reform Plan consists of the following steps for the provincial government to take:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Have BC Assessment start assessing ground rent values of all private properties in the province.</li>
		<li>Pass legislation for a province-wide minimum land value tax and the <a href="LVT-distribution-framework.html">LVT Distribution Framework</a>. The minimum rate will be scheduled to increase by 2.5-7.5 percent of ground rent every year until it reaches a target rate of 60 percent.</li>
		<li>Schedule a decrease in tax rates of Provincial Sales Tax and/or income taxes; enough to offset a majority of the increased provincial government revenue from the land value tax. Reducing PST should be prioritized over reducing income taxes.</li>
		<li>Direct the remainder of the new provincial revenue to a universal basic income program.</li>
		<li>Require all municipalties to abolish their current property taxes in favour of the new land value tax. The land value tax in each municipality must be high enough that the municipal portion of the revenue meets or exceeds the revenue raised by the former property tax, unless this would require a land value tax rate above 80%.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>This plan is a work in progress, as it has not faced enough review by British Columbian Georgists. You are encouraged to comment on it, or submit a modification on GitHub.</p>
